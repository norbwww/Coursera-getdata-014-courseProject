This repository has been created to meet Coursera "getdata-014" project assignments. In order to create tidy data set which is
described in CodeBook.md that run_analysis.R file should be launched with command: source("run_analysis.R") using R.
Further description of analysis script please see below (3).

(2) CodeBook.md
#
Code Book create for purpose of describing tidy data set generated by analysis script. Code book describes the variables, 
the data, and any transformations or work which are performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md
#
(3) run_analysis.R

Prerequisites:
R installed to computer
Dataset downloaded and extracted to working directory https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

Command executed: source("run.analysis.R")

Expected output: "output.txt" 
Expected location: working directory

Script executes following steps:

1. Reads elements of unzipped file from UCI HAR Dataset library: features.txt, test/X_test.txt, test/y_test.txt, test/subject_test.txt, train/X_train.txt, train/y_train.txt, train/subject_train.txt

2. Merges these dataset in a consistent way.
